Data Cleaning Tasks:
Are there any missing or duplicate values?
Are any numeric columns outliers (e.g., extremely high amount_spent)?
Are all countries and genders spelled consistently?
Convert joined_year into a proper date or customer age (in years) on the platform.

Customer Behavior:
What is the distribution of customer ages?
Which country has the highest number of customers?
Which gender spends the most on average?
What is the relationship between monthly visits and amount spent?

Time-Based Insights:
How many customers joined each year?
Are newer customers spending more or less than older ones?

Segmentation:
Can you segment customers into groups (e.g., low spenders vs high spenders)?
How does country affect visit frequency and spending?
